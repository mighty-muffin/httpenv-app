## Pull request expectations

PRs should use the template located at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Provide a summary, test plan and issue number if applicable, then check that:

- New tests are added when needed.
- Documentation is updated.
- `make lint` and `make format` have been run.
- The full test suite passes.

Commit messages should be concise and written in the imperative mood. Small, focused commits are preferred.

## What reviewers look for

- Tests covering new behaviour.
- Consistent style: code formatted with `uv run ruff format`, imports sorted, and type hints passing `uv run mypy .`.
- Clear documentation for any public API changes.
- Clean history and a helpful PR description.
